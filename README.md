# Hello Tensorflow

These are some simple Tensorflow scripts I put together while listening to Martin GÃ¶rner's talk, [Tensorflow and Deep Learning Without a PhD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq2nnJ4g6N0).

The [scripts directory](./scripts) contains the scripts and the [images directory](./images) contains training/test accuracy and cross entropy plots for each neural network.
